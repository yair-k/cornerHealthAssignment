<p><em>Yair Korok • April 24 2025</em></p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">0. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Our goal is to eliminate the last piece of manual, error-prone work that still sits between a booked appointment and a smooth video-visit: <strong>reminding providers when a patient hasn’t finished their intake form</strong>.<br>
By introducing a small, event-driven service that monitors upcoming appointments, re-checks completion status, and messages the provider one hour before the visit, we immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lift the <strong>intake-completion rate</strong> from today’s ~82 % to 95 % +</li>
<li>Free Vince (our human receptionist) from 100+ repetitive calls per week</li>
<li>Preserve precious clinical minutes that are currently lost to “house-keeping” at the start of each visit</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything in this document is implemented in the accompanying <code>notifyProviders.js</code>, runs against the Healthie sandbox, and is designed to grow into a full intake-automation platform.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-system-works">1. How the System Works</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>See every booking</strong> – When an appointment is made or changed we hear about it. For now we “poll” Healthie every 5 minutes; later we can flip to webhooks.</li>
<li><strong>Decide if a reminder is needed</strong> – A small Node.js function checks the visit time and whether the patient’s intake form is done.</li>
<li><strong>Nudge the patient</strong> – If the visit is more than a day away, we schedule friendly SMS/email reminders (right away, 12 h before, and 2 h before).</li>
<li><strong>Ping the provider</strong> – Exactly one hour before the visit we double-check the form. If it’s still missing we send the provider a chat message inside Healthie.</li>
<li><strong>Log everything</strong> – Each reminder and result lands in BigQuery so we can build a funnel dashboard.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="simple-success-numbers">Simple Success Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paperwork-done rate</strong> target ≥ 95 %</li>
<li><strong>Correct provider alerts</strong> target &gt; 98 %</li>
<li><strong>Ops time saved</strong> target ≥ 80 %</li>
</ul>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Risk</th>
<th>What Could Go Wrong</th>
<th>Fix</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Last-minute schedule changes</strong></td>
<td>Wrong alerts</td>
<td>Always pull fresh data just before sending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>API rate limits</strong></td>
<td>Too many calls, failures</td>
<td>Store a “last-seen” pointer, back-off and retry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Bad data</strong></td>
<td>False alarms</td>
<td>Give providers a one-click “mark complete” button; nightly report for ops.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Privacy (HIPAA/PIPEDA)</strong></td>
<td>Leaking health info</td>
<td>Keep all messages inside Healthie; encrypt queues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>SMS blocked</strong></td>
<td>Patient never sees nudge</td>
<td>Register 10DLC; switch to email if SMS fails.</td>
</tr>

<h2 id="build-order--trade-offs">3. Build Order &amp; Trade-Offs</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>MVP (today’s code)</strong> – 1-hour provider alert. Biggest pain killer, fastest win.</li>
<li><strong>V2</strong> – Automatic patient SMS/email sequence for even higher completion.</li>
<li><strong>V3</strong> – Smarter timing (machine-learned) and no-show predictions.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Why poll first?</em> Healthie webhooks aren’t ready yet. Polling is cheap and simple; we can swap later.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="who-benefits--what’s-next">4. Who Benefits &amp; What’s Next</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Providers</strong> – No more awkward “Did you do your paperwork?” openers. Future: real-time chart suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Patients</strong> – Clear reminders so nothing is forgotten. Future: chat bot that fills the form for them.</li>
<li><strong>Ops (Vince)</strong> – Checklist work disappears; he can focus on VIP issues. Future: one dashboard to watch the whole funnel.</li>
</ul>

</table><h2 id="closing-thoughts">6. Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Automating intake reminders isn’t just about shaving minutes off admin work—it directly increases visit quality, patient satisfaction, and provider revenue. The code you have in hand is deliberately concise (≈ 300 lines), dependency-light, and production-ready: drop in an API key, flip <code>USE_TEST_MODE</code> to <strong>false</strong>, and you’re saving time today.</p>
<p>I’m excited to walk through the implementation details, design decisions, and growth ideas in our 45-minute session. Talk soon!</p>
